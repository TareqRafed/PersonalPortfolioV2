# Welcome to my Portfolio!

Hi! I'm trying to create a portfolio, where you have to collect some **KEYS** which allows you to unlock some locked sections, don't worry it won't affect the UX since these keys can easily found, and the important sections such as Projects or About Me won't be locked. 

# Technologies

Currently I'm using Reactjs, SASS and [Lottie engine](https://lottiefiles.com/), still didn't decide whether I'm going to use more libraries or not.
